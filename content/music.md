I started my musical journey listening to the likes of John Denver, Fleetwood Mac, George Michael, Riverdance and many more. Music was often relegated to the living room of my household, whilst my parents did the house errands, and I sat on the floor. (*Absolute lazy this guy. Child. I should leave that*). But then came the Sony CD Walkman. I filled my world with the sounds of Michael Jackson, Linkin Park, Metallica and many more again. That began a new soundscape journey.

  
I often imagined myself as a person within the bands that I listened to but was not concerned with the instrument. But without a doubt, it moved me like nothing else. It got me through incredibly tough times and heightened the good ones.

  
I started to learn the drums, due to my disruptive nature at school, tapping and making beats with my hands. I was given a set of drums to practice with, but this soon transferred into the guitar.

  
When I watched my sister play the acoustic guitar. I was enamored by the sound, and the emotion it could deliver. From simple chords to complex lead lines, I threw myself at it like I did with everything. As time progressed, I joined my music class within my High School. I gravitated towards the Electric Guitar and was taken over by watching Kirk Hammett (*Metallica*) and Joe Satriani. (*Found on LimeWire, sorry Larz*) I started to become better. But I never imagined it to be anything more than enjoyable for my own self. It was mine, and mine alone. (*My precious*)

  
But it wasn't my guitar, thank you sis! So, this continued into joining school music groups in High School and playing a couple of performances. I then proceeded into getting a Cert II, but due to moving away from my hometown, but remaining at the school, I could not attend my Cert III after school classes. (*Classic musicians working later*). And I was forced into finding another path.

  
And that path was, practicing every hour of every single day for an entire year, then bypassing Cert III and earning the Bachelor of Music Performance from NMIT, creating two solo albums, busking on the streets of Sunbury, Melbourne, Victoria and performing at many Events, Festivals, Birthdays and Establishments as Nathan Gabriel, the Sunbury Busker. I have been able to play my original music on the radio, perform alongside some incredible musicians (*Ross Wilson and The Peaceniks, Joe Camilleri and The Black Sorrows, Richard Clapton Bongo Starkie, Spectrum, Madder Lake and more*) that I grew up listening too at Sunbury 24â€™.

  
Going forward, I have a third album PERCEPTION being worked on.
