I have been dealing with a condition called Ankylosing Spondylitis. The dictionary definition (*A form of spinal arthritis, chiefly affecting young males, that eventually causes ankylosis of vertebral and sacroiliac joints*) Long story short, it has been incredibly debilitating since a few years prior to the diagnosis on March 23rd, 2017. It has affected all aspects of my life, and maintaining a sole - trading business and life has only compounded that issue.

  
I had several health-related issues that were all based of this condition, but it took several years of extensive trial and error doctor and hospital, visits to nail down this diagnosis.

Now throughout my life, I have always felt a disconnect to the world, sometimes not being able to feel emotion during incredibly traumatic moments or presenting far too much emotion during the opposite. I never felt connected to others around me, through family, tennis, school, university, work and beyond. I kept this bottled up and maintained a very confident, well put together individual (*Just look at my school grades, except for the part about my constant disruptive nature*). Though when looking at it all objectively, I couldn't maintain friendships outside of these domains, and I quickly found I was secluding myself to my own world.

I always had a passionate mind towards anything that was right in front of me but quickly lost interest in anything that wasn't. Then here comes the kicker. It was always a part of my family discussion, the term of ADHD (*Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, often continuing from childhood into adulthood*). But when identifying whether or not I had it, it came with complicated, opposing answers, left with the understanding that I was perfectly fine.

But as I grew up with this knowledge, it wasn't matching how I was seeing things from my own perspective. It didn't even match how the world was seeing me. I was often asked from early childhood, all the way towards adulthood, whether I had 'something'. And I would confidently (*Often agitatedly*) reply, "Certain family members of mine have it, but I was told I don't".

So cut to the end of 2024, when I finally engaged in the discussion with a psychologist, I was shown results that proved I had ADHD (*Nathan's clinical presentation and assessment results are strongly consistent with the following diagnosis:314.01 (F90.2) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; Combined Presentation, and it very much present as a child*).

Then I found out that I actually was diagnosed as a child, confirming my suspicions. WHAT. Cue Netflix series. So why is this all relevant? Well, I started to grasp a lot about myself through a new lens, that felt like I had put on glasses that could fix my blurred vision.

And I've been on ADHD medication as of 2025 and things are different, go figure.
