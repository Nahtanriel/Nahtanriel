This marks the beginning of a new creative era — Nahtanriel. After years of performing under my own name, I wanted to reshape my identity into something that better represents who I am now, without the restriction of having it be my personal name. It's a name that formed many years ago when playing video games. It is my first name backwards, with the last four letters of my last name combined (*Absolute genius level*) I have, since March 3rd, 2016, created and performed music as Nathan Gabriel. It's been a long time coming, and through the years I've battled with an identity issue. I wanted to start my musical venture with a mysterious, non-personal persona that encapsulated everything about my creative mind.

Throughout the years, the pressures of life and health had pushed me towards building a career that I could comfortably make money following the music dream. In retrospect, I’m quite surprised how far I’ve come, doing things that I inherently said to myself that I wouldn’t do. It started with me wanting to become the greatest electric guitar player to ever live. And although that is a ridiculous, ego driven and moving goal post type of idea, it was something that anchored me to my creative self.

Over time, it turned from becoming a master at the guitar craft, to how can I survive. Obviously, we need money and people to live a life of opportunity and material life gain, I couldn’t be a non-working, bedroom guitar player, without a job, but with a killer Bachelor of Music Performance Certificate sitting in a frame mocking me. So, through normal life pressures, external unnecessary pressures, and internal pressures (*See About page for further detail on that bucket of stuff*)

I started to feel the powerful draw towards that beast. Now, as confirmation bias goes, I started to get validated quite quickly and became known. Like, you know, walk down the street and be stopped several times towards your destination type of known. I was able to start becoming a musical figure in my town, playing private gigs, Establishments, Birthdays, Events, Festivals, you name it. It literally is someone's dream doing what I’ve doing. It’s true, I’ve literally talked to someone who said this to my face.

But as time went on, something didn’t feel right. I started to become anxious towards going out, playing my guitar privately, learning anything hard. I started to become depressed, and (O*nce again, check the About page for some juicy info*) lost interest in what I thought was my life's goal.

But that’s the kicker, it wasn’t. I didn’t want to play gigs using other people's music, be known for acoustic guitar and singing, and as a busker. Now don’t get me wrong, it fulfilled many aspects of my life, and I’m glad it all happened. But it’s time to move on and try something different. Maybe, as this post may suggest, go back to that version of myself that just wanted to be the greatest electric guitar player. Relearn, how to learn, becoming passionate about the very foundation of my musical journey. Because I’ve discovered, through (*Oh LINK AGAIN, thanks mate*) \<\< all that \<\< that I didn’t lose the love of learning and playing guitar, I just morphed it into something else.

Now the question is, if I was able to do and see and be that constructed version of myself and become quite successful, what is possible now. Cue fearful, imposter syndrome brain. Then cue, Nahtanriel.

Thank you for being here on this musical, mad journey of mine. Let’s see what we can do now that the shackles are off. (*Cool mic drop moment and fade to black montage of me playing a guitar at the beginning of it all with a big smile on my face..........and no money. Okay flash back to now, I’ve got a PS5 and a beautiful girlfriend by the name of Vanessa Bennett, a incredibly creative person, and cat, Autumn. Phew*)

Onwards and Upwards.
