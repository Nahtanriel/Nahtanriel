Hello, and welcome to my world. My name is Nahtanriel. I am a Musician – Creator.  
I have created two solo albums, PERSPECTIVE & PERSONALITY.  
My third solo album PERCEPTION is work in progress.  
  
**PERSPECTIVE** was a passion project created in response to having many stories that I wanted to share, with a desire to condense them into a musical space. It was also the first time having to create an entire band worth of instruments and produce, mix and master all by myself.  
  
**PERSONALITY** was a passion project created in response to having a relationship, that started from a non – caring, whatever happens space, to truly showing me my deep, personal traits. Ending in finding the love of my life and having me believe in myself again.

  
**PERCEPTION** is a work in progress passion project, created in response to the many facets of my mind and beliefs. It features a broad mix of genres and sounds.

  
I am in the process of creating a video game, with a unique concept derived from the idea of the finality of life, and the process of discovering what it may mean for each of us. Currently re-learning and expanding my game engine knowledge to achieve this.

  
Please join me on this journey of creation and let us see where it goes. This is my story. (*Add copyright dun dun sound, you know the one*).
