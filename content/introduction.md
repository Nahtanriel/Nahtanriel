Hello, and welcome to my world. My name is Nathan Gabriel, now Nahtanriel. I am a Musician - Gamer - Creator. For many years I  played Tennis and got trophies, Aussie Football and got trophies, did gymnastics and got some ribbons, \_(Whoa.)\_ learnt guitar, created original music compositions, played video games and developed a passion for how they were made, spent time learning 3ds Max and Zbrush, created videos and online contetn and....other stuff.  

Over the years I have been pushed and pulled towards many things, and tried my best in each. Please join me on this journey of creation, and let us see where it goes. This is my story.  \_(Add copyright dun dun sound, you know the one)\_. </p>
