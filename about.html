        <h2>The Creation of Nahtanriel</h2>
        <p class="blog-date">October 27th 2025</p>
        <p>
          This marks the beginning of a new creative era — <strong>Nahtanriel</strong>. After years of performing under my own name, I wanted to reshape my identity into something that better represents who I am now, without the restriction of having it be my personal name. It's a name that formed many years ago when playing video games. It is my first name backwards, with the last four letters of my last name combined <i>(Absolute genius level)</i>. I have, since March 3rd, 2016, created and performed music as Nathan Gabriel.
</p> Since that time, I have created two solo albums, busked on the streets of Sunbury, Melbourne, Victoria and performed at many events, festivals, Birthdays and establishments. I have been able to play my original music on the radio, perform alongside some incredible musicians that I grew up listening too, and earn a comfortable living playing music.    
</p>        
As time went on, I started to realize that I turned my passion for guitar, into a routine job. You know, the kind whereas you do it, all you're thinking of is when will I be home. Now don't get me wrong, it has been a blast, I have learnt an incredible amount, seen some amazing things, and how many people can say that they were able to successfully live as a Full-Time musician for nearly 10 years straight? But as time went on it gnawed at my very being, made me depressed, even when the successes were sky high. It made me doubt who I was, and put me in a very dark place for several years. I tried doing Twitch Streaming, playing games and talking with others. That didn't fulfill me. I tried focusing on a third album, it wasn't feeling the same. I tried combining both and doing LIVE performances, then playing games. But as I tried all of this, whilst maintaining busking, learning my craft, playing gigs and trying to maintain my health issues, it has become too much.
</p> I started my musical journey with the sole purpose of becoming the greatest electric guitar player to ever live. <i>(What, ego, and tall order?)</i>. Well, I never aim low. And through playing all day, every day, for nearly a year, I was able to bypass Cert II and Cert III, to begin my Bachelor Of Music Performance. Fast forward, I have been unaware that I have since put that aside, and traded it for a comfortable living, performing as an Acoustic Guitar player and singer. Now on paper, this seems like a reasonable trade, I literally am living what some people may call a dream. But over the years I have always felt like something was missing, something wasn't being fulfilled. That passion and joy of the Electric Guitar, disappeared.  
</p> Now, on that health note, I have been dealing with a condition called Ankylosing Spondylitis. The dictionary definition <i>(a form of spinal arthritis, chiefly affecting young males, that eventually causes ankylosis of vertebral and sacroiliac joints.)</i> Long story short, it has been incredibly debilitating since a few years prior to the diagnosis on March 23rd 2017. It has affected all aspects of my life, and maintaining a sole - trading business and life has only compounded that issue. Now throughout my life (zooming out further?!) I have always felt a disconnect to the world, sometimes not being able to feel emotion during incredibly traumatic moments, or presenting far too much emotion during the opposite. I never felt connected to others around me, through family, tennis <i>(yeah I played tennis and became quite good)</i>, school, universtiy, work and beyond. I kept this bottled up and maintained a very confident, well put together individual <i>(just look at my school grades, except for the part about my constant disruptive nature)</i>.  
</p> Though when looking at it all objectively, I couldn't maintain friendships outside of these domains, and I quickly found I was secluding myself to my own world. I always had a passionate mind towards anything that was right in front of me, but quickly lost interest in anything that wasn't. Then here comes the kicker. It was always a part of my family discussion, the term of ADHD <i>(Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, often continuing from childhood into adulthood)</i>. But when identifying whether or not I had it, it came with complicated, opposing answers, left with the understanding that I was perfectly fine. But as I grew up with this knowledge, it wasn't matching how I was seeing things from my own perspective. It didn't even match how the world was seeing me. I was often asked from early childhood, all the way towards adulthood, whether I had 'something'. And I would confidently (often agitatedly) reply, <i>"Certain family members of mine have it, but I was told I don't"</i>   
</p> So cut to the end of 2024, when I finally engaged in the discussion from my own thoughts, with my psychologist. I was shown results that proved I had ADHD <i>(Nathan’s clinical presentation and assessment results are strongly consistent with the following diagnosis:314.01 (F90.2) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; Combined Presentation , and it very much present as a child.</i> Oh, then I found out that I actually was diagnosed as a child, but that was hidden from me. WHAT. Cue Netflix series. So why is this all relevant? Well I started to grasp a lot about myself through a new lens, that felt like I had put on glasses that could actually fix my blurred vision. And I've been on ADHD medication for a month and things are <i>different</i>, go figure. So having always been quite introspective, and highly sensitive to other's opinions, and my own fearful ones, I created a job from nothing. I quite literally had $12 in my pocket at the end of my Bachelor Of Music Performance and first album, was kicked out of my home and had to reassess what was next. Cut to nearly 10 years later, through countless opposition, negative people with their own fearful projections, I have successfully built a role as a professional musician, that I can only see getting bigger and better. So, that's where we cut to this very day.
</p> <strong>I don't want to do it anymore.</strong> Well, not like what I've been doing. I am now known as Nahtanriel, and I will be starting effectively from scratch. Now, I've built a following from my local town, knowing me as the Sunbury Busker. I have performed a lot, for a long time, under the banner of Nathan Gabriel. I have successfully maintained and grew my sole - trading music business. But now I want something new. What does that look like? Well, you'll have to stay tuned for that. But, look forward to hearing about a new video game I have been creating <i>(Like a whole game?! Yes)</i>, my third album, and new video material that is much broader than ever before for me. It's time for a larger version of myself, unrestricted by my innate people pleasing, highly influenced brain, and fearful mind. Here is to a new creative future. Please join me. Onwards and Upwards.
